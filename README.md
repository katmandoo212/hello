# Brian Taylor's Projects

This GitHub presents projects that I have been working on.  It demonstrates some of the programming languages that I use.  It is meant to convey some of my skills as a software developer, but is by no means totally comprehensive.  Some of these projects are complete executable programs of some utility, some are only code snippets demonstrating knowledge of a certain aspect of software development.

I will be adding and changing these projects regularly.

If you have received my resume as part of a job application, hopefully you will find this GitHub useful as part of your selection process.
